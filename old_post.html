	<h1>Status Update 1</h1>
	<p>I am creating new assets which I have not yet completed so I am using simple shapes as placeholders. The black circle stands for the character at rest and facing forward. The blue flashing circle stands for the turn cycle and the light grey flashing circle stands for the character’s walk cycle.</p>
	<p>The first thing I did was create user controlled character movement using the arrow keys using if statements and event listeners. Next I created parallax scrolling and implemented a ‘dead zone’ that takes up the middle 50% of the screen. I had problems here – eg, the character walk animation would stop playing when I hit the dead zone even though the arrow was pressed and the character was still moving, or the character would get stuck at the edge of the dead zone. I solved this by using more specific if statements.</p>
	<p>I solved the problem of keyboard polling using enter frame events. This made the parallax scrolling stop working, but I fixed this by changing the layout of my code and putting all commands inside one large enter frame event.</p>
	<p>Next I made the character animation play. Placing different animations inside symbols in the character’s timeline made accessing them simpler and kept it neater.</p>
	<p>I had trouble making the turn cycle play only once when a key was pressed. I solved this using a Boolean that would switch to true once the turn cycle was played, stopping it from being played again. It only reverts to false when the key is lifted and the character stops. I could only get this to work if the turn cycle is out on the Character’s main timeline, not imbedded inside a symbol. </p>
